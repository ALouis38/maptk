~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Motion-imagery Aerial Photogrammetry Toolkit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MAP-Tk is an open source C++ collection of libraries and tools for making
measurements from aerial video.  Initial capability focuses on estimating
the camera flight trajectory and a sparse 3D point cloud of the scene.
These products are jointly optimized via sparse bundle adjustment and are
geo-localized if given additional control points or GPS metadata.

This project has similar goals as projects like Bundler_ and VisualSFM_.
However, the focus here in on efficiently processing aerial video rather than
community photo collections. Special attention has been given to the case where
the variation in depth of the 3D scene is small compared to distance to the
camera.  In these cases, planar homographies can be used to assist feature
tracking, stabilize the video, and aid in solving loop closure problems.

The MAP-Tk software architecture is highly modular and provides an algorithm
abstraction layer that allows seamless interchange and run-time selection of
algorithms from various other open source projects like OpenCV, VXL, Ceres
Solver, and PROJ4.  The core library is light-weight with minimal dependencies
(C++ standard library, Vital, and Eigen).  The tools are written to depend
only on the MAP-Tk and Vital core libraries.  Additional capabilities are
provided in plugin modules that use third party libraries to implement various
abstract algorithm interfaces defined in the core.  Plugin modules may also
implement additional versions of core MAP-Tk data structures.

In addition to the libraries and tools, a Qt GUI application is provided to
assist with visualization of data and results with the help of VTK.
The screenshots below show the MAP-Tk GUI visualizing results of MAP-Tk
run on example videos from the `VIRAT Video Dataset`_ and `CLIF 2007 Dataset`_.
More information about this example data can be found in the
`examples <examples>`_ directory.

While the initial software implementation relies on batch post-processing
of aerial video, our intent is to move to an online video stream processing
framework and optimize the algorithms to real-time performance for use
onboard unmanned aerial vehicles.

======================= ========================================================


Building MAP-Tk
===============

MAP-Tk uses CMake (www.cmake.org) for easy cross-platform compilation. The
minimum required version of CMake is 3.0, but newer versions are recommended.

Currently, a compiler with at least partial C++11 support (e.g. GCC 4.4, Visual
Studio 2013) is required.


Running CMake
-------------

We recommend building MAP-Tk out of the source directory to prevent mixing
source files with compiled products.  Create a build directory in parallel
with the MAP-Tk source directory.  From the command line, enter the
empty build directory and run::

    $ ccmake /path/to/maptk/source

where the path above is the location of your MAP-Tk source tree.  The ccmake
tool allows for interactive selection of CMake options.  Alternatively, using
the CMake GUI you can set the source and build directories accordingly and
press the "Configure" button.


CMake Options
-------------

============================== =================================================
``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``          Build shared libraries (.so/.dylib/.dll)
``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``           The compiler mode, usually ``Debug`` or ``Release``
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``       The path to where you want MAP-Tk to install

``MAPTK_ENABLE_MANUALS``       Turn on building the user documentation (manuals)
``MAPTK_ENABLE_DOCS``          Turn on building the Doxygen documentation
``MAPTK_INSTALL_DOCS``         Install Doxygen documentation (requires above
                               enabled)
``MAPTK_ENABLE_TESTING``       Build the unit tests

``MAPTK_ENABLE_CERES``         Turn on building the Ceres Solver plugin module
``MAPTK_ENABLE_OPENCV``        Turn on building the OpenCV plugin module
``MAPTK_ENABLE_PROJ``          Turn on building the PROJ.4 plugin module
``MAPTK_ENABLE_VISCL``         Turn on building the VisCL plugin module
``MAPTK_ENABLE_VXL``           Turn on building the VXL plugin module

``MAPTK_USE_BUILD_PLUGIN_DIR`` Add the path to plugins in the build directory to
                               the plugin search path
============================== =================================================

.. note::

  Shared libraries (``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON``) is required to support dynamic
  plugin loading


Dependencies
------------

MAP-Tk has minimal required dependencies at the core level.  Enabling
plugins adds additional capabilities as well as additional dependencies.
Some functionality is duplicated between modules to provide choices.
Feature tracking requires OpenCV or VisCL. Bundle adjustment requires
Ceres Solver or VXL.  Geographic transformations require PROJ4.

Required
''''''''

The only hard dependencies of MAP-Tk are on the C++ standard library,
Vital_ (|>=| 0.1), and Eigen_ (|>=| 3.0; also required by Vital).

Optional Plugins
''''''''''''''''

Each MAP-Tk plugin module brings in more dependencies for additional
functionality.  Dependencies for each module are:

* Ceres  : version 1.10.0 or greater
           http://ceres-solver.org/
* OpenCV : version 2.4.X (with X >= 6, 3.X support coming soon)
           http://opencv.org/
* PROJ   : version 4.7
           http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/
* VisCL  : experimental code (unversioned, use master branch)
           https://github.com/Kitware/VisCL
* VXL    : version 1.17 or greater
           http://vxl.sourceforge.net/

GUI
'''

The visualization application (GUI) is optional, and has additional
dependencies.  To build the GUI, you need:

* Qt 4         : version 4.8.0 or greater (4.8.6 or greater recommended)
                 http://www.qt.io/
* qtExtensions : no versioned releases as of writing; use master branch
                 http://www.github.com/kitware/qtextensions
* VTK          : version 6.2
                 http://www.vtk.org/

Documentation
'''''''''''''

Documentation generation is another optional component that brings in
additional dependencies.  To build the API documentation, you need:

* Doxygen  : version 1.7 or greater
             http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

To build the user manual(s), you need:

* Python   : version 2.6 or greater
             http://www.python.org/
* Docutils : version 0.11 or greater
             http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

(At present, only the GUI has a user manual.  Other manuals may be added in the
future.)

================================= ===============================================

Building Documentation
----------------------

If ``MAPTK_ENABLE_DOCS`` is enabled, and CMake finds, or is provided with, a
path to the Doxygen tool, then the HTML documentation is built as part of the
normal build process under the target "doxygen".  Open
``${MAPTK_BUILD_DIR}/docs/index.html`` in your browser to view the
documentation.

If ``MAPTK_ENABLE_MANUALS`` is enabled, and CMake finds, or is provided with, a
path to the Python executable which is able to import docutils, then the user
manuals are built as part of the normal build process under the target
"manuals".  The GUI manual can be viewed from inside the GUI by choosing the
"MapGUI User Manual" action from the "Help" menu.


Testing
========
Continuous integration testing is provided by CDash_.
Our `MAP-Tk dashboard <https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=MAPTK>`_
hosts nightly build and test results across multiple platforms including
Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Anyone can contribute a build to this dashboard using the
`dashboard script <CMake/dashboard-scripts/MAPTK_common.cmake>`_
provided.  Follow the instructions in the comments.


`Travis CI`_ is also used for continued integration testing.
Travis CI is limited to a single platform (Ubuntu Linux), but provides
automated testing of all topic branches and pull requests whenever they are created.

MAP-Tk Tools
============

MAP-Tk command line tools are placed in the ``bin`` directory of the build
or install path.  These tools are described below.


Summary of MAP-Tk Tools
-----------------------

The primary tools are ``maptk_track_features`` and
``maptk_bundle_adjust_tracks``. Together these form the sparse bundle
adjustment pipeline.  The other tools are for debugging and analysis purposes.

``maptk_track_featues``
  Takes a list of images and produces a feature tracks file.

``maptk_bundle_adjust_tracks``
  Takes feature tracks and produces cameras (KRTD files) and 3D points (PLY
  file). Can also take input POS files or geo-reference points and produce
  optimized POS files.

``maptk_pos2krtd``
  Takes POS files and directly produces KRTD.

``maptk_analyze_tracks``
  Takes images and feature tracks and produces tracking statistics or images
  with tracks overlaid.

``maptk_estimate_homography``
  Estimates a homography transformation between two images, outputting a file
  containing the matrices.


Running MAP-Tk Tools
--------------------

Each MAP-Tk tool has the same interface and accepts three command line
arguments:

* ``-c`` to specify an input configuration file
* ``-o`` to output the current configuration to a file
* ``-h`` for help (lists these options)

Each tool has all of its options, including paths to input and output files,
specified in the configuration file.  To get started, run one of the tools
like this::

    $ maptk_track_features -o config_file.conf

This will produce an initial set of configuration options.  You can then edit
``config_file.conf`` to specify input/output files, choices of algorithms, and
algorithm parameters.  Just as in CMake, configuring some parameters will
enable new sub-parameters and you need to re-run the tool to get the updated
list of parameters.  For example::

    $ maptk_track_features -c config_file.conf -o config_file.conf

The above command will overwrite the existing config file with a new file.
Ordering of entries and comments are not preserved.  Use a different output
file name to prevent overwriting the original.  Continue to adjust parameters
and re-run the above command until the tool no longer reports the message::

    ERROR: Configuration not valid.

Note that the config file itself contains detail comments documenting each
parameter.  For each abstract algorithm you must specify the name of variant
to use, but the list of valid names (based on which modules are compiled)
is provided directly in the comment for easy reference. When the config file
is complete and valid, run the tool one final time as::

    $ maptk_track_features -c config_file.conf

An easier way to get started is to use the sample configuration files for each
tool that are provided in the ``examples`` directory.  These examples use
recommended default settings that are known to produce useful results on some
selected public data samples.  The example configuration files include the
default configuration files for each algorithm in the ``config`` directory.
